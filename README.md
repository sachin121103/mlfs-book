The lab contains the files for the E and C assignment for Lab 1 - Air Quality Sensors. The city we chose for this project is Sundsvall, specifically the Sundsvall Köpmansgatan sensor found here: https://aqicn.org/city/sweden/sundsvall-kopmansgatan/

The notebooks 1-4 contain the pipeline in order: Starting from the Backfilling data, to moving to the Daily Feature Pipeline and Training Data pipeline. Finally, we perform batch inference and the output is visible in the dashboard linked above.
